Written Report

In dealing with the task to look more into Louise Kickstarter's data, we set the flirters in the category to theaters and analyze the outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on the date launch. Based on the date of the launch we see more successful campaigns than failed campaigns in the year 2018 which has the highest campaign success. At looking at outcomes based on goals the common mode for percentage success is 1.9 and the mode for percentage failed is 2.7 meaning that there were more failed campaigns than success based on Goal ranges. Based on the data most campaigns launched in 2014 through 2018 were successful but as a whole, the campaigns generally did well. In conclusion, the data presented could have been shown with a pie chart instead of a line chart. In analyzing we are looking into a small scope in the flirter range when dealing with theater. We could analyze all theater categories and come up with a more finely detailed conclusion in what campaigns and areas to showcase truly what would excel in the real world.
